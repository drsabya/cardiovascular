    "correct": "130/80 mmHg on repeated standardized readings",
    "wrong": "≥130/90 mmHg on a single clinic reading",
    "reasoning": "AHA/ACC 2025 keeps the diagnostic threshold at ≥130/80 mmHg based on outcome data showing increased CV risk above this level."

    "question": "What is the BP goal for most adults?",
    "correct": "<130/80 mmHg in treated adults",
    "wrong": "<135/85 mmHg for all adults",
    "reasoning": "Trials show lowering BP to <130/80 mmHg reduces stroke, MI, and heart failure in most adults."

    "question": "Preferred method to confirm hypertension?",
    "correct": "HBPM/ABPM confirmation preferred",
    "wrong": "Office BP alone is sufficient",
    "reasoning": "Out-of-office readings (HBPM/ABPM) avoid white-coat effect and better reflect usual BP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is white-coat hypertension?",
    "correct": "High office BP, normal ABPM/HBPM",
    "wrong": "High office BP, slightly high ABPM",
    "reasoning": "In white-coat hypertension, stress in the clinic raises BP, but ambulatory/home readings remain normal."

    "correct": "Normal office BP, high ABPM/HBPM",
    "wrong": "Normal office BP, borderline ABPM",

    "correct": "Start meds if ASCVD ≥10% or TOD present",
    "wrong": "Start meds only if BP >140/90",
    "reasoning": "In low-risk stage 1 HTN lifestyle alone is acceptable, but high ASCVD risk or TOD justifies adding drugs."

    "question": "When is dual therapy recommended?",
    "correct": "Dual therapy for Stage 2 HTN",
    "wrong": "Dual therapy only after monotherapy failure",
    "reasoning": "Stage 2 hypertension or BP far above goal usually needs two drugs to reach target quickly and safely."

    "question": "Why avoid ACEi + ARB combination?",
    "correct": "ACEi + ARB increases harm without benefit",
    "wrong": "ACEi + ARB lowers BP more effectively",

    "question": "Role of renal denervation?",
    "correct": "RDN for selected true resistant HTN",
    "wrong": "RDN as first-line for most HTN",

    "question": "Drugs that worsen BP?",
    "correct": "NSAIDs, OCPs, steroids raise BP",
    "wrong": "ACE inhibitors raise BP",

    "correct": "<130/80 with individualization",
    "wrong": "<120/70 for all older adults",

    "question": "Define hypertensive emergency.",
    "correct": "Severe BP + organ damage",
    "wrong": "Severe BP without organ damage",
    "reasoning": "Emergency is distinguished by acute target-organ damage, which mandates rapid IV BP control."
  },
  {
    "question": "Define hypertensive urgency.",
    "correct": "Severe BP without organ damage",
    "wrong": "Severe BP with acute organ injury",
    "reasoning": "Urgency has severe BP elevation but no organ damage, so gradual oral reduction is safer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What BP suggests emergency/urgency?",
    "correct": "≥180/120 mmHg but organ injury defines emergency",
    "wrong": "≥150/90 mmHg defines emergency",
    "reasoning": "Very high numbers like ≥180/120 mmHg are concerning, but organ damage defines an emergency."

    "question": "Exception with special BP target?",
    "correct": "Aortic dissection needs SBP <120",
    "wrong": "Pulmonary edema needs SBP <120",

    "question": "First step for STEMI at non-PCI hospital?",
    "correct": "Check for shock or severe HF",
    "wrong": "Give nitrates immediately",
    "reasoning": "Shock or severe HF dramatically increases risk and mandates rapid transfer for definitive PCI."
